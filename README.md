# Employee Clock in System
(Developer: Devan Hayes)

## Project Goals
Employee Clock In System is a program that allows employees of a business to clock in and out. This Facilitates the owners with the necessary data they need to track the employees' hours.

## User Experience
The user first decides which option they would like to do, then a google sheet is updated with the data. 

### Options Menu
#### Options
    - The options menu has four options to choose from.
        - Option one allows the user to clock in by entering their employee number.
        - Option two allows the user to clock out.
        - Option three allows the user to add new employees to the list of current employees
        - Option four allows the user to quit running the program.

#### Clock-in 
    - The clock-in option allows an existing employee to enter their employee number.
    - This then creates a new row in the Google Sheet (employee_clocking_system) and inputs the employees number, name and time of clock in.
